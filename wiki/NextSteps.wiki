Add your content here.  Format your content with:
  * Add slug for Course, Section and Subsection    DONE 
  * Add columns in listing for Course, Section and Subsection DONE
  * Allows sorting Section by Course DONE
  * Add support for simple markup
  * Add features to save text into HTML whenever Section or Subsection is saved
  * Add view to view course as single book
  * Add view to view outline of course
  * Create PDF slide deck with just Course, Section and Subsection

This should be enough to keep me busy for a while.
